# markupTohtml_UI

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end**: React.js

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies for  front-end

   - **For the front-end**:
     ```bash
     cd markupTohtml_UI
     npm install
     ```

## Front-end Setup

PORT:3000

1. Navigate to the front-end directory:

   ```bash
   cd markupTohtml_UI
   ```

2. Install front-end dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. To run the front-end in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the React development server, and you can view the front-end application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or a different port, depending on your configuration).

## Running the Application

- **Front-end**: Make sure to run `npm start` from the `markupTohtml_UI` directory.

After running both servers, your full-stack application should be up and running. The front-end will communicate with the back-end through API calls.

## Scripts

- **For the front-end**:
  - `npm start`: Runs the front-end development server.
  - `npm run build`: Builds the production-ready front-end.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that both front-end and back-end are running on different ports to avoid conflicts.
- If you encounter issues with dependencies, try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again.
- Check the terminal logs for any errors that might indicate missing or incorrect configurations.
